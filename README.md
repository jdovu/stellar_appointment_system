# **Stellar Appointment System**

This is a simple microservice that lets you schedule, cancel, and view appointments. It uses **ZeroMQ** for communication and **SQLite** to store the data. The idea is to make a lightweight and easy-to-run system for handling appointments.

But you're here now?
---

## **What This Does**
- Lets you **schedule** an appointment by providing a name, date, and time.
- Lets you **cancel** an appointment by giving its ID.
- Lets you **view all** appointments for today.

It's all done through **ZeroMQ messages** instead of an API, so you need to send JSON requests.

## **How to Set It Up**

### **1. Install Python Stuff**
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:
```bash
pip install pyzmq sqlite3
```

### **2. Set Up the Database**
Run this to create the database file (`appointments.db`):
```bash
python -c "import database; database.init_db()"
```

### **3. Start the Microservice**
Run the server so it starts listening for appointment requests:
```bash
python scheduler.py
```

## **How to Send Requests**

### **Using Python (One-Liner Command)**
Instead of making an API call, you talk to the service through **ZeroMQ**. Here are some quick one-liners to test it:

#### **Schedule an Appointment**
```bash
python -c "import zmq, json; s=zmq.Context().socket(zmq.REQ); s.connect('tcp://localhost:5555'); s.send_string(json.dumps({'action': 'schedule', 'patient': 'John Doe', 'date': '2025-02-10', 'time': '14:30'})); print(s.recv_string())"
```

#### **Cancel an Appointment**
```bash
python -c "import zmq, json; s=zmq.Context().socket(zmq.REQ); s.connect('tcp://localhost:5555'); s.send_string(json.dumps({'action': 'cancel', 'appointment_id': 123})); print(s.recv_string())"
```

#### **View Todayâ€™s Appointments**
```bash
python -c "import zmq, json; s=zmq.Context().socket(zmq.REQ); s.connect('tcp://localhost:5555'); s.send_string(json.dumps({'action': 'view_today'})); print(s.recv_string())"
```

---

## **Future Enhancements (Maybe?)**
- Right now, it's just using **ZeroMQ**, but adding an **HTTP API** (like Flask or FastAPI) would make it easier to test with curl.
- Could add more features like rescheduling an appointment instead of just canceling.
- Maybe store more appointment details, like location or doctor name?

That's it! Just run the server, send some messages, and you should see appointments being saved and retrieved. Let me know if you have any issues! ðŸš€
